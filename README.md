## Free tool for learning by using flashcards.

This is my first React project with I made completely from scratch without any help. 

My idea for app and my code = lots of 
satisfaction.

### I don't concentrate on css here I made this to train Hooks and to have good App for me and my friends to learn.

### What I used:

* React,
* React Router,
* React Icons,
* Bootstrap (a little),
* Scss.

### What I would improve?

Definitely I should use useContext, sometimes I had problem with dealing props.
